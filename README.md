## MP3 ID3V1\.1/ID3V2\.3\.0 Tagger \*UPDATE\*


</div>

### Description

This is a complete application that shows you how to: 1) Read an MP3 file to determine Bitrate, Length, Etc. 2) Read/Write ID3V1 1.1 Tags 3) Read/Write ID3V2 3.0 Tags. I was debating on whether or not to submit this code, but I decided to. Two small procedures were borrowed and modified from PSC code (SetBit, and CreateUnsyncInteger), other than that, all code is mine. In terms of ID3V2 3.0 tags, not all frames are supported, but the code is written to EASILY add other frame support. Also, this code will allow you to read/write the ID3V2 3.0 Lyrics and Picture Frames. This code also shows you how to allow multiple picture frames in the tag. While there may be some bugs left in this program, the read/write functionality has been incorporated via class files - making it easy to port this code into your application. If you like this code, please tell me! If you find a bug, I'd like to know as well. I hope someone out there can make use of this. As far as I can see, this is the most comprehensive ID3 tagger on VB PSC. It took me a decent amount of time to get this working, so please, comments (and votes) are welcome! ***I have updated the code to include a couple of bug fixes, and the ability to read/write Synchronized Lyrics as well!*** This is yet another update...all I did was update the SyncLyrics to allow you to insert the time from Winamp... Also, I am also submitting my WinAMP front so you can test the SyncLyrics as well, search for other submissions of mine, and you'll see it. I have updated yet once again! Now you can import LRC files! For those of you that don't know what an LRC file is - it's a Syncronized Lyric file...makes things a little easier I hope. Alos you can copy the lyrics back and forth between the Syncronized and UnSyncronized Lyrics!
 
### More Info
 
A valid MP3 file.

If you are trying to work with an MP3 file that includes other versions of tags (ID3V2 2.0, or ID3V2 4.0), this program will not work. This is ONLY intended for use with ID3V1 1.1, and ID3V2 3.0 Tags.
